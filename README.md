    -   **Scale**: Resize elements using handles or input fields.
    -   **Skew**: Skew elements along the X and Y axes.
-   **Animation Controls**:
    -   Set and adjust keyframes.
    -   Control animation duration, delay, and easing functions.
-   **Preview & Playback**:
    -   Play, pause, and reset animations.
    -   Real-time previews of transformations and animations.

    -   Save and reload projects for continued editing.
